Stefan WOLTRAN
I studied Computer Science at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology) and received my diploma in February 2001. In May 2003, I received my PhD in Computer Science. From July 2001 to May 2007 I was working as a project research assistant in the Knowledge-Based Systems Group on projects funded by the Austrian Research Fund (FWF). They were about QBF encodings and afterwards about ASP-equivalence. Since June 2007, I am an assistant professor at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2). In November 2008, I received my Habilitation in the area of ``Information Systems'' at the Faculty of Computer Science of TU Wien. From August 2013 to January 2015, I have been associate professor at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2). In Winter Term 2013, I held a deputy professorship at Leipzig University. Since February 2015, I am full professor for "Formal Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2),
