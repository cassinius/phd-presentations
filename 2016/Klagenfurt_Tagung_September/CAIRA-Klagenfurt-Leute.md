## Ernst BUCHBERGER

Ernst Buchberger holds a diploma in computer science from the Vienna University of Technology and a doctorate with a thesis on natural language generation. He is Assistant Professor at the Section for Artifical Intelligence of the Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, which he joined as a Research Assistant in 1981 (then Department of Med. Cybernetics of the University of Vienna). In 1984, he also joined the then newly founded Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI). From Sept. 1994 to April 1995, he was a guest researcher at the Institut f. Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung (IMS) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

### Fields of interest:

* Natural Language Processing / Computational Linguistics (NLP / CL), with special emphasis on Natural Language Generation and Speech Synthesis
* support language teaching and on extracting structured information from (medical) natural language texts.

### Press coverage:

* Google & Co.: Noch viele Probleme bei Echtzeitübersetzung:
Die größten Erfolge, die unter anderem durch die statistische Auswertung von vorhandenem zweisprachigem Material erreicht wurden, basieren allerdings auf schriftlicher Sprache“, sagt Ernst Buchberger vom Institut für Artificial Intelligence an der Medizinischen Universität Wien, im Gespräch mit der futurezone.
Gesprochene Sprache sei ungleich komplexer, da neben der immer noch nicht perfekt funktionierenden Spracherkennungssoftware auch der Kontext berücksichtigt werden müsse, um den Sinn zu verstehen.
* Fiktionale Sprachen - Esperanto & Klingonisch
* Chatbots

=> This one might be a little problem due to the fact that our newest project is about NLP as well, but I am not an expert in the field yet. Maybe we should still change the abstract text of my talk ()



## Stefan WOLTRAN

I studied Computer Science at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology) and received my diploma in February 2001. In May 2003, I received my PhD in Computer Science. From July 2001 to May 2007 I was working as a project research assistant in the Knowledge-Based Systems Group on projects funded by the Austrian Research Fund (FWF). They were about QBF encodings and afterwards about ASP-equivalence. Since June 2007, I am an assistant professor at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2). In November 2008, I received my Habilitation in the area of ``Information Systems'' at the Faculty of Computer Science of TU Wien. From August 2013 to January 2015, I have been associate professor at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2). In Winter Term 2013, I held a deputy professorship at Leipzig University. Since February 2015, I am full professor for "Formal Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" at the Database and Artificial Intelligence Group (184/2),

### Research

* Answer set problems... for formalization of complex reasoning (but not for huge data as of yet)
* Treating Hard Problems with Decomposition and Dynamic Programming
	- Divide & Conquer
	- Recursive programming
* In reality, social networks are not random graphs and medical ontologies are not arbitrary sets of relations. Thus, structural parameters can serve as a key to apply recent techniques from the area of parameterized complexity
* Abstract argumentation
( GRAPPA: A Semantical Framework for Graph-Based Argument Processing )

> Conclusion: Overlapping interests in graph theory / social networks / medical ontologies - however he seems to be a BIG DATA GUY and not directly interested in our fields like 'network anonymization' or word vectors...


## Franz WOTAWA

### Most recent papers:

* Model-based diagnosis of hardware designs:
The state of the art in hardware design is the use of hardware description languages such as VHDL...
=> 1999
* Testing with model checkers: a survey
About a decade after the initial proposal to use model checkers for the generation of test cases we take a look at the results in this field of research. Model checkers are formal
verification tools, capable of providing counterexamples to violated properties.
=> 2009
* Diagnosing tree-structured systems:
This paper introduces the TREE/TREE∗ algorithm for computing minimal diagnoses for tree-structured systems. Diagnoses are computed by descending into the tree, enumerating the input combinations that might be responsible for a given incorrect observation, and combining the diagnoses for the subtrees generating these inputs into diagnoses for the whole system. Algorithm TREE diagnoses systems containing functional components and algorithm TREE∗ diagnoses more general constraint-based components
=> 2001

### Most recent papers:

* Using Modelica Programs for Deriving Propositional Horn Clause Abduction Problems
Abstract Despite ample advantages of model-based diagnosis, in practice its use has been somehow limited to proof-of-concept prototypes.
* Classifying Test Suite Effectiveness via Model Inference and ROBBDs
* Empirical study of correlation between mutation score and model inference based test suite adequacy assessment

> Conclusion: no real overlapping interests


## Gerhard Friedrich

Works with Wotawa, Felfernig (Model based system)

### Most cited papers

* Recommender systems: an introduction
=> with Alexader Felfernig
In this age of information overload, people use a variety of strategies to make choices about what to buy, how to spend their leisure time, and even whom to date. Recommender systems automate some of these strategies with the goal of providing affordable, personal, and high-quality recommendations. This book offers an overview of approaches to developing state-of-the-art recommender systems.
=> 2010

* Configuring large systems using generative constraint satisfaction
Abstract Generative constraint satisfaction solves problems using a constraint network that is extended during the configuration process. Generative constraints hold for all components of a given type and are used as generators for extending the configuration including the constraint network.
=> 1998

* Conceptual modeling for configuration of mass-customizable products
In this paper, we show how to employ a standard design language (Unified Modeling Language, UML) for modeling configuration knowledge bases.
=> 2001

### Most recent papers

* Tractability frontiers of the partner units configuration problem
Abstract The partner units problem (PUP) is an acknowledged hard benchmark problem for the Logic Programming community with various industrial application fields like surveillance,
electrical engineering, computer networks or railway safety systems.

* Heuristic constraint answer set programming
Constraint answer set programming (CASP) is a family of hybrid approaches integrating answer set programming (ASP) and constraint programming (CP). These hybrid approaches have already proven to be very successful in various domains. In this paper we present the CASP solver ASCASS (A Simple Constraint Answer Set Solver), which provides novel methods for defining and exploiting problem-dependent search heuristics

* Learning Algorithms for Diagnosis

In this paper we show how an important similarity based technique–ID3-like classification tree generation [Qui33]-can be improved using additional domain theory axioms.

> Conclusion: No overlapping interests (except the overview paper on recommeder systems - READ !!)

## Radu Grosu

### Most cited papers

* From MSCs to statecharts (model checking systems?)
Abstract We present a first step towards a seamless integration of MSCS into the system development process. In particular, we show how scenario-based system requirements, captured in the early system analysis phase using MSCS, are translated into state-based description techniques like Statecharts. To this end, we sketch a schematic integration of
MSCS and Statecharts.
=> 1999

* Modular specification of hybrid systems in CHARON
Abstract We propose a language, called Charon, for modular specification of interacting hybrid systems. For hierarchical description of the system architecture, Charon supports building complex agents via the operations of instantiation, hiding, and parallel composition.
=> 2000

* Monte carlo model checking
Abstract We present MC 2, what we believe to be the first randomized, Monte Carlo algorithm for temporal-logic model checking. Given a specification S of a finite-state system, an LTL formula ϕ, and parameters ε and δ, MC 2 takes M= ln (δ)/ln (1–ε) random samples (random walks ending in a cycle, ie lassos) from the Büchi automaton B= BS× B¬ ϕ. to decide if L (B)=∅.
