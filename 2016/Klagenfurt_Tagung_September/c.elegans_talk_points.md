how does a single neuron work?

POSTSYNAPTIC NEURON:

- stimulus
- leak channel
- SK channel
- k+ channel
- ca2+ pump
- ca2+ channel
- gap junction
- chemical synampse

INSIDE: Calcium Buffering

Differential equation

* Ionic Channel's Conductance: Gion = Gmaxm^ph^q
* Gate activation function:
* Potassium Current
* Leak current

* Inflow of Calcium current, Ica, from extracellular fluid through the calcium channel
* A chemical reaction with the calcium binding buffer proteins
* Calcium pump which carries Ca out...

### Simulation

Applying current stimuli to a single neuron and observing its membrane potential
* Excitatory Synapse
* Inhibitory Synapse
* Gap Junction


### Literature:

* Hodgkin, et al (1952)

### Tests:

Neural Circuit Implementation has been checked by IMP (Institute of Molecular Pathology)

### Application:

Automatic parking inspired by part of the mechanosensory neural circuit
