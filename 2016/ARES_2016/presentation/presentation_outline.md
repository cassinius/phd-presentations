# PAML - ML on perturbed knowledge bases / presentation outline

### TOC

1. The right to be forgotten
2. Impact on different DB layers
3. Focus on ML databases
4. Two scenarios
    * Selective deletion of valuable data points
    * Wholesale anonymization of the dataset
    * Why is that different from simply having less data?
5. Logistic regression yields coefficients
6. Deleting 0.2 to 1.0 of specified data points
7. Results of selective deletion
8. Anonymization - k anonymity / datatypes
9. Generalization hierarchies
10. The SaNGreeA algorithm / the SIL formula
11. different weight vectors
11. by what k-factors the datasets were anonymized
12. Results
13. Initial Conclusion - deletion better than anonymization
14. Future work
    * Other ML techniques - prediction / clustering etc.
    * Other perturbation techniques
    * Graph-based datasets (graph perturbation...)
15. Thank you!
